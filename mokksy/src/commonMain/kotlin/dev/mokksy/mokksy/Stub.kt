/**
 * Represents a mapping between an inbound [RequestSpecification] and an outbound response definition.
 *
 * This class encapsulates the logic needed to handle HTTP requests and responses, including
 * matching request specifications, sending responses, and handling response data of various types.
 * Resembles the [WireMock Stub](https://wiremock.org/docs/stubbing/) abstraction.
 *
 * @param P The type of the request payload.
 * @param T The type of the response data.
 * @param configuration Defines the behavior and attributes of the stub, including its name
 *          and logging verbosity settings.
 * @property requestSpecification Defines the criteria used to match incoming requests.
 * @property responseDefinitionSupplier Supplies the [ResponseDefinitionSupplier] for a matched request.
 *          This includes headers, body, and HTTP status code, which are applied to the HTTP response.
