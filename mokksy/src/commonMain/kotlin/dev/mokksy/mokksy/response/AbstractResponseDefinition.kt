 * Represents the base definition of an HTTP response in a mapping between a request and its corresponding response.

 * @param T The type of the response data.
 * @property contentType The MIME type of the response content.
 * @property httpStatusCode The HTTP status code of the response as Int, defaulting to 200.
 * @property httpStatus The HTTP status code of the response. Defaults to HttpStatusCode.OK.
 * @property headers A lambda function for configuring the response headers. Defaults to `null`.
 * @property headerList A list of header key-value pairs to populate the response headers. Defaults to an empty list.
 * @property delay A delay applied before sending the response. Defaults to Duration.ZERO.
 * @property responseBody The optional response payload associated with this definition.
